# Angular Todolist

This is the first Angular 6 Projet that I have done, in this project I have realised the function as follow:

1.As a user, I can add a TODO to the list.
2.As a user, I can see all the TODOs on the list in an overview.
3.As a user, I can delete a TODO.
4.As a user, I can mark a TODO as completed.

Also since the time manner I am still working on sub-level todos and time related functions when I submit the project.

Please see the instruction below:
